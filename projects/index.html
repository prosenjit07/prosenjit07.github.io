            <h3>welcome</h3>
            <p style="color:rgb(249, 249, 250);"> Hi there! My name is Prosenjit Chandra Biswas who was born in 2000 in
                cumilla. I passed HSC examination in 2019 from Birshreshtha Noor Mohammad Public College. After
                rejecting my acceptance to a pure science subject at Jagannath University, I decided to admit my
                passionate subject to a reputed private university. I'm studying
                at CSE since 2020. I have interested in Competitive Programming, Robotics as well as Web Developing.
                C/C++ Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Web developing are just a few of the skills I've
                learned and I also enjoy them.
                <br> <br>
                My fascination with programming and computers began in elementary school when I first encountered
                computer code, which is utilized to build the website. I was completely enthralled by programming and
                was inspired to start working on modest projects of my own, usually basic websites. New challenges and
                problem-solving situations always inspire me to push the boundaries of my knowledge. I would like to
                play cricket, read books, listen to music, and travel.
